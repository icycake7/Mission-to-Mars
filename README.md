# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose:
#### Robin is fascinated with space and the universe. Her dream is to work for NASA. In order to achieve this goal, she has started a project called "Mission to Mars." In order to impress NASA, she wants to create an application that will let her scrape websites with the click of a button. Since full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres have piqued her interest, she has tasked us to create a website that would scrape and display the newest images from Mars’s hemispheres with their respective titles.
